# Run automated part of the tests specified by the release specs (see
# https://github.com/RIOT-OS/Release-Specs/) on `native` and IoT-LAB boards.
#
# It is split into `native` tests and IoT-LAB tests, as the tests are
# resource-wise disjunct and thus can be run parallel. For each IoT-LAB board
# test an IoT-LAB experiment is started using the `rici` account.
#
# This workflow is run periodically on master with a cron job, on new pushed
# release candidates tags and release tags, and can be triggered via workflow
# dispatch.
